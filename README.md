Welcome to one of the first projects I made with Unity Engine.

Key Features of this project: 

Object-Oriented Programming: I've built this project on the principles of object-oriented programming, allowing for modular and maintainable code, making it easy to extend and enhance.

C# Interfaces: I harnessed the power of C&#35 interfaces to create a flexible and extensible architecture, making it easy to integrate new components and features.

Input Diversity: The system caters to a wide range of gamers by providing support for both mouse and keyboard, as well as controller input. Players can choose their preferred input method for an immersive gaming experience.

C# Events: I employ C&#35 events to facilitate efficient communication and coordination between different components of the game, enhancing interactivity and responsiveness.

Organized Folder Structure: The project features a well-organized folder structure, ensuring that code and assets are neatly categorized, making it easy to navigate and maintain.
